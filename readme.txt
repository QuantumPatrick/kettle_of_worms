This program is called "Kettle of Worms and Other Such Nonsense." It was
written on a lark to make a randomized list of silly animals in various
forms of containers. For example: "kettle of worms", "tube of frogs", or
"basket of blobfish". This isn't worth your time, but I hope you have
fun with it.
